Generation of analysis data: 

- dictionary_file_based_class.py : altered run code used that allows for computing run time of inputted operations 
- results.py: code that runs the dictionary_file_based_class.py for every tested input set 20 times and saves the averages on a csv file 
- output.csv: data out from the previous run of results.py
- data.xlsx: all data obtained for experimentation purposes 
- words_alpha.txt : list of 370105 words used to test dictionaries 
- wordsXXXX.txt: generated input data files 
- testXXX.in : generated input operation files 
- Generation.ipynb: code used for data generation and analysis
