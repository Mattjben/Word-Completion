# Word-Completion

The objective of this project is to implement three different dictionaries containing words and thier respective frequencies each contained within different data sturcture types (linked list , array , trie) and compare and compute the practical and theoretical time complexities of various operations. 


## FILES: 
- Report.pdf: Report that details our experimental setup , results and disccussion for comparing the different data structures 
- dictionary file based.py: Code that reads in operation commands from file then executes those on the specified nearest neighbour data structure.
- >USE  `python3 dictionary_file_based.py list sampleDataToy.txt testToy.in testToy.out`
